    "description": "The java New I/O (NIO) packages in J2SE 1.4 introduce many new, indispensable features previously unavailable to Java programmers. These include APIs for high-performance I/O operations, regular expression processing, and character set coding. These new libraries are a treasure trove for java developers. The NIO APIs are especially valuable where high-performance I/O is a requirement, but they can also be useful in a wide range of scenarios. The new APIs let you work directly with I/O buffers, multiplex nonblocking streams, do scattering reads and gathering writes, do channel-to-channel transfers, work with memory-mapped files, manage file locks, and much more. The new high-performance Regular Expression Library provides sophisticated, Perl-like regex-processing features such as pattern matching, search and replace, capture groups, look ahead assertions, and many others. The Charset API gives you complete control over character set encoding and decoding, which are vital for properly managing the exchange of documents on the Web, for localization, or for other purposes. You can also create and install your own custom character sets. Staying current with the latent java technology is never easy. NIO, new in Java 1.4, is quite possibly the most important new java feature since Swing. Understanding it thoroughly is essential for any serious Java developer. NIO closes the gap between java and natively compiled languages and enables java applications to achieve maximum I/O performance by effectively leveraging operating-system services in a portable way. Java NIO is a comprehensive guide to the java New I/O facilities. It lots you take full advantage of NIO features and shows you how they work, what they can do for you, and when you should use them. This book brings you up to speed on NIO and shows you how to bring your I/O-bound Java applications up to speed as well. Java NIO is an essential part of any Java professional's library.",

    "description": "The networking capabilities of the Java platform have been extended considerably since the first edition of the book. This new edition covers version 1.5-1.7, the most current iterations, as well as making the following improvements: The API (application programming interface) reference sections in each chapter, which describe the relevant parts of each class, have been replaced with (i) a summary section that lists the classes and methods used in the code, and (ii) a \"gotchas\" section that mentions nonobvious or poorly-documented aspects of the objects. In addition, the book covers several new classes and capabilities introduced in the last few revisions of the Java platform. New abstractions to be covered include NetworkInterface, InterfaceAddress, Inet4/6Address, SocketAddress/InetSocketAddress, Executor, and others; extended access to low-level network information; support for IPv6; more complete access to socket options; and scalable I/O. The example code is also modified to take advantage of new language features such as annotations, enumerations, as well as generics and implicit iterators where appropriate. Most Internet applications use sockets to implement network communication protocols. This book's focused, tutorial-based approach helps the reader master the tasks and techniques essential to virtually all client-server projects using sockets in Java. Chapter 1 provides a general overview of networking concepts to allow readers to synchronize the concepts with terminology. Chapter 2 introduces the mechanics of simple clients and servers. Chapter 3 covers basic message construction and parsing. Chapter 4 then deals with techniques used to build more robust clients and servers. Chapter 5 (NEW) introduces the scalable interface facilities which were introduced in Java 1.5, including the buffer and channel abstractions. Chapter 6 discusses the relationship between the programming constructs and the underlying protocol implementations in more detail. Programming concepts are introduced through simple program examples accompanied by line-by-line code commentary that describes the purpose of every part of the program. No other resource presents so concisely or so effectively the material necessary to get up and running with Java sockets programming. Focused, tutorial-based instruction in key sockets programming techniques allows reader to quickly come up to speed on Java applications. Concise and up-to-date coverage of the most recent platform (1.7) for Java applications in networking technology.",

Look no further! Effective Java™, Second Edition, brings together seventy-eight indispensable programmer’s rules of thumb: working, best-practice solutions for the programming challenges you encounter every day. This highly anticipated new edition of the classic, Jolt Award-winning work has been thoroughly updated to cover Java SE 5 and Java SE 6 features introduced since the first edition. Bloch explores new design patterns and language idioms, showing you how to make the most of features ranging from generics to enums, annotations to autoboxing. Each chapter in the book consists of several “items” presented in the form of a short, standalone essay that provides specific advice, insight into Java platform subtleties, and outstanding code examples. The comprehensive descriptions and explanations for each item illuminate what to do, what not to do, and why. Highlights include: New coverage of generics, enums, annotations, autoboxing, the for-each loop, varargs, concurrency utilities, and much more Updated techniques and best practices on classic topics, including objects, classes, libraries, methods, and serialization How to avoid the traps and pitfalls of commonly misunderstood subtleties of the language Focus on the language and its most fundamental libraries: java.lang, java.util, and, to a lesser extent, java.util.concurrent and java.io Simply put, Effective Java™, Second Edition, presents the most practical, authoritative guidelines available for writing efficient, well-designed programs.",

Like every How to Program book, \"Java How to Program, Fifth Edition\" features the Deitels' signature \"LIVE-CODE\" ™ approach to teaching programming languages with thousands of lines of live code, explained with exceptional clarity by the renowned programming trainers at Deitel and Associates. The Deitels cover all facets of the Java language, including object-orientation, multithreading, exception handling, the Java event programming model, GUI with Swing and AWT, graphics, and much more. You'll also find a set of core design patterns that are integrated throughout the text along with all new coverage of JDBC, SQL, n-tier, Web-application development with servlets and JSP, plus an introduction to XML processing with the Java XML library. The book also provides an optional, start-to-finish case study introducing Java object-oriented analysis and design with UML. It contains hundreds of tips, recommended practices and cautions (all marked with icons) for writing code that is portable, reusable and optimized for performance. For all beginning programmers -- and developers experienced with traditional languages -- who want to master Java quickly.",
